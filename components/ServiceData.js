It should have been installed above grade level by a minimum of 8 inches. Parge should be troweled on as it resists the water, snow and salt, and protects the foundation. Another reason that brick spalling occurs is when there is no flashing or weep vents properly installed. If you can visually see the vents, they may be plugged. Lack of vents or plugged vents does not allow water to drain to the outside of the home or building.
